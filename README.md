# K-Means-Clustering-for-Product-Segmentation-from-Weekly-Sales-Data
K-means Clustering Technique Applied for product segmentation for effective Inventory Management

Conclusions: The model gives us some great insights by segmenting 811 products of an retail company with similar/cyclical buying pattern over a period of 1 year. This can help us the retail shop manage their inventory better using lowering costs and raising revenue by placing the orders in synchornization woth the buying cycles.

Dataset Description: This is a massive database of 54,000+ rows of sales data for 811 different products sold over a year for a global retail company.

The predictors are anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in routine blood analysis. Prediction models based on these predictors, if accurate, can potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer.
